Abstract:
E-commerce is the platform where sellers can sell products and customers can buy them. For this case study, we have taken the dataset given by Olist, which is an e-commerce platform in Brazil. Olist wants to improve the business as well as provide better service to customers by using the customer satisfaction information.

In the present system, customers give ratings out of 5, and also can write comments/reviews about the product that he/she has purchased. Using these, e-commerce platforms will rate the products, which helps other people to get insights about the quality of the product. According to the seller, these reviews will play a crucial role to improve the business. But many times, customers would not give any ratings or reviews. Predicting the review score by customers is the main problem in e-commerce business.

The machine learning classification  models are used for predicting customer satisfaction. Since the data has a binary target variable, we are planning to perform a Binary Classification model; and our goal is to predict whether the customer is satisfied or not based on the same.
